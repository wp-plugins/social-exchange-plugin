= How does it work? =

We help WordPress Users and Social Media Bloggers to get more Likes and Shares through a points-based reciprocal system. 

It works like this:

* when you install the plugin we give you FREE points
* you spend your points giving them to people sharing your content (you spend 5 points to get 1 share)
* you get more points by sharing others content (you get 4 points for sharing 1 post)
* you have total control over what content you share on your social accounts. You can choose to share or skip

= Tips and Tricks =

You can check how many shares any website has here: [CHECK HOW MANY SHARES http://moresharesforyou.com/URL/](http://moresharesforyou.com/URL/ "Check How Many Points I  
Have On A Specific Page"). You can use this for any site, yours or your competitors, even if they don't run WordPress.

IMPORTANT: USE SOCIAL BUTTONS. You should *display the Facebook LIKES button on your posts and pages* so your audience can see on your website the number of Likes.  
(Facebook adds the likes and the shares into 1 single metric). This is an important social proof indicator for your readers.

EQUALLY IMPORTANT: USE PRETTY PERMALINKS. Facebook and the other social networks "count" your likes/shares in relation to a certain URL. Please make sure you *have the final URL Pretty Permalink in place* before starting a campaign. Otherwise, if you change the URL later, Facebook will not display your previous like numbers.

The most easy way to SEE HOW IT WORKS is to press play button for your homepage.

It's a WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME to have a good website/blog that nobody is seeing or reading.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

* How many points do I have to spend for one share? *

You spend 5 points to get one share of your post, on one Social Network.

* How many points do I earn for sharing one post for other users? *

You earn 4 points for sharing one post on one Social Network. If you share the same posts on all 4 networks (Facebook, Twitter, Google, LinkedIn), you'll get 16 (4x4)  
points.

* Can I share my Homepage? *

Yes, in the main plugin dashboard. We recommend you start with it since it's the most easy way to get it going.
Just press play to start sharing your homepage.

* How will I get my posts shared? *

It's easy. You just set the number of maximum shares you'd like for that post. 
You can start sharing your posts in the edit post/page WordPress editor. Just edit your post and set the maximum number of shares you need for that specific post. If  
the maximum value is reached, your post will be no longer shared.
Also you can manage your campaigns (Start, Stop, set a Maximum number of shares) more easily from All posts/ All pages interface in your Wordpress Dashboard.

* What if I run out of points? *
You will not receive any more shares for your posts. Earn more points by sharing other posts or visit our website [MoreSharesForYou Points] 
(http://moresharesforyou.com/get-more-points/) - we award promotional points regularly.

* I've just installed the plugin, but I can't see any Social Media icons on my website *
This plugin is not for showing  social media buttons on your site, but for increasing your shares on social networks. If you want to show them up to your readers,  
install any social media plugin from the WordPress repository.

* How can I see how many shares I have on my homepage or a specific post or a page *
You can check it here: [CHECK HOW MANY SHARES I HAVE http://moresharesforyou.com/URL/](http://moresharesforyou.com/URL/ "Check How Many Points I Have On A Specific  
Page")
